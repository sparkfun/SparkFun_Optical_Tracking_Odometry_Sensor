The SparkFun Optical Tracking Odometry Sensor needs to be rigidly mounted to a robot chassis and oriented flat to the floor. We've designed a few 3D printing models you can use, but you may need to design your own mount for this board, depending on your use case. Accurate readings really require that the sensor is mounted correctly; attempting to move the sensor by hand can work, but tracking accuracy will suffer.
