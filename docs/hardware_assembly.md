The SparkFun Optical Tracking Odometry Sensor needs to be rigidly mounted to a robot chassis and oriented flat to the floor. If you don't already have a chassis, we've designed a few 3D printing models you can use. That said, you may need to design your own mount for this board, depending on your use case. 

You can access these designs here:

!!! warning

	Accurate readings require that the sensor is mounted correctly; attempting to move the sensor by hand may work, but tracking accuracy will suffer.

The image below shows the 3D mounted clip with the Optical Tracking Sensor attached to an XRP:

!!! attention

	Reminder - make sure you peel off the yellow kapton tape!

The height that the sensor needs to be mounted will be dependent on the surface being read. Glossy surfaces are ideal; running a calibration will determine the necessary height.

	FIRST Tech Challenge: Note here that we are using the foam surface typical of FIRST Tech Challenge competitions and the sensor is mounted at 10mm from the surface.
