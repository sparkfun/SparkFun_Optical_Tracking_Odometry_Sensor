	If this is your first time working with Python, there are quite a few useful tutorials on getting started. The [Python Programming Section](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/python-programming-tutorial-getting-started-with-the-raspberry-pi/programming-in-python) of our Getting Started with the Raspberry Pi Tutorial has some good basic information and resources for getting started with Python. 

We've written a python package to get you started with the SparkFun Optical Tracking Odometry Sensor. It's been included in the SparkFun Qwiic Python package, which aggregates all Python Qwiic drivers/modules to provide a single entity for Qwiic within a Python environment. The [Qwiic_Py GitHub Library ReadMe](https://github.com/sparkfun/Qwiic_Py) has more information on the Qwiic Python package. 

If you already have your Qwiic Python package installed, you can update it with the following command: 

```
pip install --upgrade sparkfun-qwiic

```

If you don't have the Qwiic Python package installed already, you can install it with the following command: 

```
pip install sparkfun-qwiic

```


If you prefer to install just this package, use the following command: 

```
pip install sparkfun-qwiic-otos

```






If you prefer downloading the code to build and install the package manually, you can grab them from the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/sparkfun/Qwiic_Py).

In addition to the package provided here, we have written a Python script that allows you to visualize the XRP in real time. Download via the button below.
